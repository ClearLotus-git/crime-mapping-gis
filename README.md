# Crime Mapping GIS Project

This project visualizes crime data using GIS tools in Python. It includes scripts to:
- Plot crime incidents on a map
- Generate heatmaps
- Convert data into GeoJSON for spatial analysis

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run scripts from the `scripts` folder to generate maps and GeoJSON files.

## Use Cases
- Urban safety planning
- Crime pattern analysis
- Law enforcement support

## Sample Dataset
Located in `data/crime_data_sample.csv`

## Output
HTML maps will be saved in the `outputs` folder.
